# CWE-Net: Cross Weather Expert Network for Adaptive Image Restoration

This repository accompanies our AAAI 2026 submission **"CWE-Net: Cross Weather Expert Network for Adaptive Image Restoration"**.

## 🔍 Overview

CWE-Net is a modular image restoration architecture designed to handle **single** and **compound/mixed** weather degradations like haze, rain, snow and thier combination. It features:

- Expert branches for haze, rain, and snow.
- A weather classifier-based soft routing mechanism.
- A cross-weather expert (CWE) decoder for composite refinement.
