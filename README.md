# CWE-Net: Cross Weather Expert Network for Adaptive Image Restoration

This repository accompanies our journal submission to *Image and Vision Computing*, titled **"CWE-Net: Cross Weather Expert Network for Adaptive Image Restoration"**.

## 🔍 Overview
**CWE-Net** is a modular and interpretable image restoration framework designed to handle both single and compound weather degradations such as **haze**, **rain**, **snow**, and their combinations.  
It features:
- **Base Weather Experts (BWEs)** specialized for individual weather conditions.  
- A **weather classifier-based soft routing mechanism** for adaptive expert activation.  
- A **Cross-Weather Expert (CWE) module** for learnable feature-space fusion and composite refinement.
